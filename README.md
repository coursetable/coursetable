# Coursetable

Coursetable is made of two big parts:

1.  **Website**: this is the site you see when you go to [coursetable.com](https://coursetable.com). The code for this is in the `web` directory.
2.  **Crawler**: these are the scripts behind the scenes that actually get all the data from Yaleâ€™s websites. The code for this is in the `crawler` directory, which is currently included via a Git submodule.

## How to develop

The latest development instructions are now maintained in a Google Doc called the [CourseTable development guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0Gp8Qtaik8roGYYknDDEzAAOwP3YBj0mX1pvCy-uOI/edit?usp=sharing).

The document includes instructions on how to:

1.  Set up the dev environment
2.  Learn about the code
3.  Make your first changes

## Workflow

**Contributing code:**

1. Create a branch for your feature. This can usually be done with `git checkout -b <username>/<feature_name>`
2. *make changes.*
3. Create some commits and push your changes to the origin.
4. Create a pull request and add a few reviewers. In the pull request, be sure to reference any relevant issue numbers.
5. Once the pull request has been approved, merge it into the master branch.

**Issues:**

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests: https://github.com/coursetable/coursetable/issues.

## Style

For different languages:

- Javascript: We use `prettier` to automatically format the code. Make sure you use your editor's integration!
- PHP: We use PHP CodeSniffer to maintain coding standards; generally, it's 4 spaces for tabs, camelCase for variables, and follow whatever else that's in use right now.

We have automated checks set up that will run for every commit and pull request.

## (Mostly for Peter and Harry) Steps for rolling out a new server

1.  Create a SSH key, and add it as a deploy key for both this repository and
    `install-scripts`.
2.  Run `cd /home/web && git clone git@gitlab.com:myrtlelime/coursetable.git app`
3.  Run `install.sh`
4.  Run `components/gencerts.sh` to generate certificates if needed
5.  Load the database locally, if needed
6.  Run `finish-install.sh`

## Steps for setting up debugging on Windows

1.  Change `web/includes/ProjectCommon.php` to point to a remote database
2.  Run `composer install` in `web/libs` and in `crawler`
3.  In your php.ini, make sure cURL, MySQLi, SQLite3 are enabled
4.  Run `php Build.php` in `web/tools`
5.  Run `php RegenerateDataFiles.php` in `crawler` to either generate the JSON locally

## Debugging Tips

`Fatal error: Uncaught SmartyException: unable to write file [...]`: execute `chmod -R 777 web/gen` in your terminal.
