# Coursetable

Coursetable is made of two big parts:

1.  **Website**: this is the site you see when you go to [coursetable.com](https://coursetable.com). The code for this is in the `web` directory.
2.  **Crawler**: these are the scripts behind the scenes that actually get all the data from Yale’s websites. The code for this is in the `crawler` directory.

## How to develop

The latest development instructions are now maintained in a Google Doc called the [CourseTable development guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0Gp8Qtaik8roGYYknDDEzAAOwP3YBj0mX1pvCy-uOI/edit?usp=sharing).

The document includes instructions on how to:

1.  Set up the dev environment
2.  Learn about the code
3.  Make your first changes

## Workflow

**Contributing code:**

1. Create a branch for your feature
2. *make changes*
3. Create some commits and push your changes to the origin
4. Create a merge request and wait for review
5. When merging, choose the option to squash, and ensure that the pull request number is included in the commit title and issue numbers are included in the commit description

**Issues:**

We use GitLab issues to track bugs and feature requests: https://gitlab.com/coursetable/coursetable/issues.

## Style

For different languages:

- Javascript: We use `prettier` to automatically format the code. Make sure you use your editor's integration!
- PHP: We use PHP CodeSniffer to maintain coding standards; generally, it's 4 spaces for tabs, camelCase for variables, and follow whatever else that's in use right now.

## (Mostly for Peter and Harry) Steps for rolling out a new server

1.  Create a SSH key, and add it as a deploy key for both this repository and
    `install-scripts`.
2.  Run `cd /home/web && git clone git@gitlab.com:myrtlelime/coursetable.git app`
3.  Run `install.sh`
4.  Run `components/gencerts.sh` to generate certificates if needed
5.  Load the database locally, if needed
6.  Run `finish-install.sh`

## To rebuild JS on main site

Check out [How to deploy](docs/how-to-deploy.md)

## Steps for setting up debugging on Windows

1.  Change `web/includes/ProjectCommon.php` to point to a remote database
2.  Run `composer install` in `web/libs` and in `crawler`
3.  In your php.ini, make sure cURL, MySQLi, SQLite3 are enabled
4.  Run `php Build.php` in `web/tools`
5.  Run `php RegenerateDataFiles.php` in `crawler` to either generate the JSON locally
