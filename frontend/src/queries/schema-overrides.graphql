# This schema narrows the auto-generated schema by Hasura so we can have stricter
# and better types. See https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/3451
# For each scalar declaration, you need to add its definition in queries/graphql-types.ts
# and connect it in graphql-codegen.ts
scalar Season
scalar Crn
scalar ExtraInfo
scalar StringArr
scalar NumberArr
scalar TimesByDay

# IMPORTANT: make sure what you add here actually exists on the model!
