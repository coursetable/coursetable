          <p>
            CourseTable offers a clean and effective way for Yale students to
            find the courses they want, bringing together course information,
            student evaluations, and course demand statistics in an intuitive
            interface.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Evaluations are not everything! Professors' personalities and
              teaching styles are often divisive, and you will likely enjoy a
              class up your alley more than the random, most-highly evaluated
              class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sophomores and freshmen: keep in mind highly-evaluated seminars

        <>
          <p>
            We first merge evaluations across the different cross-listings of a
            course. Once we've done this, we compute average overall ratings and
            workloads for each instance of a course, where different semesters
            or sections constitute different instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class ratings are an average of the average overall rating for
            every instance of a course code in our database. Similarly, the
            workload rating is an average of the average workload ratings. If a
            class has multiple sections, each section goes into this average as
            a separate number. If the class is cross-listed under multiple
            course codes, any match course code is included in the computation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The professor rating is an average of the average overall rating for
            every course which a professor has taught. A course is included in
            this calculation even if it was co-taught with other professor(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            We have course evaluation data going back to 2009. All of this data
            is included in the ratings calculations.
