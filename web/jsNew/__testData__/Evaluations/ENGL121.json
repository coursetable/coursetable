      "I learned so much about effective writing. More than I've ever learned in most of my other courses ever put together. It was that good. I have edited my friends' papers late in this semester, and they've been blown away by how easily I can recommend edits to make their prose more readable and easy to understand. I've also learned some things about legal analysis and interpretation, but this is an English class through and through. This is a class where I feel like my tuition was a good deal for what I learned. Seriously. I cannot recommend this course enough, even if you aren't into law that much. Just take something with Ehrgood. The man is an English God. Don't go through Yale without him.",
      "This class brought my writing to life. My goal coming into this class was to learn how to write more concisely. I came out of the class learning how to write with brevity and energy. I learned how to improve both my writing style and critical thinking skills. I learned how to think like a lawyer when I read cases and summarized their \"deep issues.\" And I learned how to think like a judge when I wrote a judicial opinion about a morally and legally ambiguous case. Writing this judicial opinion allowed me to explore my own jurisprudence -- which type of legal argument do I find most convincing? textual arguments? purpose arguments? policy arguments? history arguments?. Taking this class helped me further understand how I think about the law.",
      "I did a lot of thinking and writing about the law, which--as I learned--requires thoughtfulness, persuasion, and precision. This class was really good practice in all those areas.",
      "Lots of grammar/style work to make your writing more concise and precise, super interesting insights about the law and legal discourse/philosophy, and fiery discussions will definitely enrich how you approach writing and legal theory and cases.",
      "Got a lot of practice in legal writing, especially in terms of labeling rules (rather than just loosely defining \"good\" and \"bad\" legal writing). Also had great fun thinking in a legal way.",
      "This is perhaps the only English course I've taken (I took another ENGL121 section and ENGL120 previously) where I genuinely felt like my writing skills improved. Professor Ehrgood is really dedicated to teaching his students concrete and applicable rules to write more concisely and persuasively, a skill that is useful not only for legal writing, but also for writing of any kind. The course also taught me new ways to think about the law -- why laws are created, what compels people to follow (or not follow) them, and what the roles of lawyers and judges are in dealing with the law.",
      "This course is broken up into two main insights: (1) learning about jurisprudence, different philosophies of law, and different ways of making an argument and analyzing text; and (2) honing writing skills towards concision and precision.",
      "This course allowed me to enormously improve my writing skills. I already considered myself to be a fairly strong writer but Professor Ehrgood helped me think about sentence construction and other seemingly small details that actually made a big difference in my writing. I also developed a much better ability to think in a legal way and to fully see all my thoughts through to their logical conclusions. I think doing this was a really great exercise for someone hoping to go to law school (or for anyone really).",
      "This class greatly improved my ability to write coherently and clearly.",
      "Wow, Ive learned too much to write here. But most importantly, Ive learned how to become a better thinker and writer through this class. This is the most challenging and yet most interesting class Ive taken at Yale. The style exercises weekly and style tests helped me improve immensely as a writer and the debates and case law assignments helped me improve as a listener and a debater. Im so so so grateful to have taken this class."

    "strengthsWeaknesses": [
      "Strengths: Andrew Ehrgood is an immortal being on Earth. He'll schedule meetings whenever you want, even on Saturdays. His feedback on your papers is nice, doesn't feel like you're being ripped apart, but also gives you tremendous insight into what you could do better. I wish I'd been getting feedback this good on other assignments in other courses; maybe I'd have majored in something related to writing. I don't want my critiques to dissuade anyone from taking this course, and I only write what follows to provide suggestions to make it even better. Like, this entire course is a strength, and there should be only one thing that *actually* might dissuade you from taking it... The workload. Ok, so this felt like a two-credit course. Or more. I knew this course would be a lot and took a relatively easy load alongside it, but even if this were your only course, the work would still stress you out. This is not a bad thing... I can safely say that all of the work was worth something, and that I learned something from everything I did, which is a rarity at Yale. There is infinitely much to get out of this course, and I just which I had infinitely much time with which to do it. But at the same time, the high time commitment will be a deterrent to some people who simply have too many other irons in the fire to make the most of this course. Therefore, here are a couple of suggestions for improvement: 1. I think there was one exam too many. We learned very few new principles between the second and third style exams, and the former of those came on the same week that our major draft was due. So I would recommend cutting it. I think this course has plenty of evaluative assignments and assessments, and I don't think the gain from the second style test was worth the onerous pressure it put on us during an already exceptionally busy week. Plus, it takes a while to memorize all of those rules. I understand that they are necessary to the course, but maybe some could be left off the style exams--I don't think G20 and up were really used on the style exams, for example. This would have eased the memorization load and the writing load (I felt rushed trying to complete the actual problems on the style exams because it took me so long to write the rules). 2. I wish the first paper had been wrapped up sooner. I wish either that the entire timeline had been moved up or that we did not have to do the lengthy revision assignment. The revision assignment is due at the end of reading period, and then we have yet another exam and another entire paper due. This is just too much, I think. And I've spent so much time staring at the same paper prompt that I really am burned out on the Speluncean Explorers and their necessity defense. I don't want to complain about this, because I really have learned a lot from each revision, including the one I should be doing right now instead of writing this. But for the sake of sanity and other courses, I think Paper 1 was milked just a bit too much. Maybe making the workshop assignments shorter would have helped too. I don't know--I really *like* everything we did with it. But I think it was too much for one course.",
      "I truly do not think there are any weaknesses of the course itself. Yes, there is a lot of work, but all of the work that Professor Ehrgood assigns serves a larger purpose and really, there is no unnecessary work. The strengths are that it teaches you so many skills (see above answer) and that it allows you to get to know one of the most invested and hard working professors at Yale.",
      "This class was almost perfect, except that the rote memorization for style tests sucked. I know Prof. Ehrgood won't change the way he does it (where's his doubt now?) but it just seems like a waste of tuition dollars to sit in my room memorizing stylistic principles, instead of practicing applying them. This is crowding out at work! The benefits of inculcating these particular principles must be weighed against the usefulness of further application of those principles. For instance, I didn't think there was nearly enough self-editing, one of the most useful stylistic exercises we did! But other than that, the class was great.",
      "Strengths are Prof. Ehrgood, the fascinating course material, and the tangible improvement of your writing. Weaknesses are that some people can end up taking up a lot of space in simple roundtable discussion--perhaps some occasional restructuring by activity, group discussion, etc. might help.",
      "The only weakness I can think of is that it's very frontloaded (though I know Prof Ehrgood knows this); by the end of the semester, I had about 15-30 minutes of prep time before class, versus upwards of two hours in the beginning of the semester. It's not even a bad thing, though. Felt pretty great at the end. Strengths are far too numerous to list. The biggest is Professor Ehrgood himself, a wonderful, patient, kind man.",
      "The course is extremely well-organized and well-presented -- Professor Ehrgood adheres to each of the weekly schedules he creates, and I knew what to expect going into every paper and exam. But there were also many pleasant surprises in class: I found myself intrigued by every discussion we had and the many different directions in which it went, due partly to my fellow classmates, and partly to Professor Ehrgood's skill as a conversation facilitator. I can think of very few weaknesses of this course. Grading can be tough, and the workload is relatively high, but I don't really count these as weaknesses -- just things to consider if you're planning to take the course. If you are admitted to it (as far as I can tell, it is by random selection after preregistration), I would certainly recommend it.",
      "Strengths: Well-balanced between the mechanics of legal writing, as well as the analysis and thought of legal writing; fun homework assignments and great discussions in class; a variety of components creating a grade for the semester Weaknesses: Perhaps more guidance and time spent on the second (and final) paper would be better, but nothing major; might be more interesting and more fun if there were more diversity of interests in the class (i.e., less pre-law students??), though this might be something that can't be helped due to self-selection.",
      "I absolutely loved this course and benefitted enormously from it. Professor Ehrgood is extremely commited to his students and met with us each individually many different times to go over our progress in the course. He even gives his students his phone number and encourages them to text or call him if they have any questions. The two writing assignments were really challenging and made me think harder than I have had to for any other college assignment. Class is productive and Professor Ehrgood puts a lot of time into thinking through how to use every minute of his time to allow his students to learn the absolute most they can. I can't think of any weaknesses of this course. The parts of the class I didn't personally enjoy were still enormously beneficial to me.",
      "Strengths: we learn so much in part because of the challenging nature of the weekly assignments and in part because the professor provides us with such extremely thorough feedback on our work. The students are all so excited about the class because the professor makes it exciting and Ive learned so much about normative ethics from their comments as well."

    "recommend": [
      "Yes yes yes yes yes. A million times over. This is going to take your writing not to the next level, but to the next thousand levels. Ehrgood is the most committed professor I've ever had, and he wants us to succeed just as much as we do. But, I cannot recommend enough that you take this course alongside an otherwise light workload. This class will keep you busy every week, and in some weeks (the one where the first paper is due and there's a style test and also reading/finals week) you will basically have to live and breathe it. That is, if you want to get the most of it. So yeah, if you just want some of the good effects and are busy, then consider Cr/D'ing it. But if you really want to get the most out of it, prepare to spend a LOT more time on it than you probably have for any other course. I'd say that, done right, it's as much time commitment as PChem Lab.",
      "Yes!!! If you have any interest in attending law school (or, even if you have an interest in improving your writing), then take this course. Though my engagement with the course was not as high in the beginning because I was not sure where the direction of a lot of assignments was going, I became more engaged and learned to love this course as the semester went on. I improved immensely as a writer largely because Professor Ehrgood took the time to tell me what I need to work on and to listen to my ideas. I have not had a professor as invested in his students as Professor Ehrgood, and that is really what makes this class so great. Because he is so engaged, everyone else is, and during the 1 hour 15 minute seminar, which, by the way, flies by, you can tell that everyone is truly fully present.",
      "Take the class! The work is great, and it makes you think deeply and write precisely. Great for the law-inclined and the law-adamantly-dinsinclined alike!",
      "Yes! Consider taking it credit-d, though, since the distribution is kind of tough and everybody can seem really deserving. (no shame--seems a decent fraction of our class did so)",
      "100% take this course. I think every other comment says this too. It's an absolute blast -- you learn a lot about legal writing (or at least get a lot of practice, even if you're already familiar with \"good\" legal writing) and get to exercise those skills while exploring intricate and interesting legal issues (but no prior knowledge required! It was all just fun with language that we could all understand). Class time is always useful and fun; I was always excited to head to WLH. Professor Ehrgood is an incredible professor: kind, patient, funny, helpful, gentle. He had multiple hour-long meetings with each of the students during the semester. If you can get in, take this course for no other reason than to be able to hang out with him. What a privilege.",
      "Yes, definitely!",
      "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Ehrgood is engaging, and cares so much about his students--he puts so much time and effort into reading and commenting on our writing, and helping us improve in identified areas. You can tell that this course is very thorough and well-thought through, and class often whizzes by because discussions are so interesting. Whether you know you want to go to law school, aren't sure, or aren't remotely interested, you will definitely take something away from the course--it might be a new way of thinking about law and society and morals, or better writing skills, or both! Note that this course is front-loaded, and quite a bit of work, but it is definitely worth it.",
      "This was definitely the best class I've taken at Yale. I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in improving their writing. Take the course if you want your ideas challenged and you want to learn how to back up your opinions. Take the course if you want to see if you enjoy legal analysis and writing. Take the course even if you do not enjoy learning about how to write better because struggling through the style exercises will most definitely make you a better writer. Take it! (if you can get in)",
      "Yes Yes Yes",
      "I would recommend this class for students who FIRST AND FOREMOST have the time to take it. It is more work than Ive ever had in any other non-STEM class at Yale. And the most WRITTEN work of any class Ive taken at Yale. BUT I would recommend ANY student to free up time in their schedule so they can take this course because they will learn MORE about how to write and debate and think about law and ethics than they will learn in probably ANY other course at Yale. They will become more keen thinkers and philosophers during this course. Take it take it take it."
